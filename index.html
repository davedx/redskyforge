				<h3>Who we are</h3>
				
				<p>We are a development and consultancy service based in the Netherlands, serving clients around the world. We use Behaviour Driven Development to produce high quality software that does exactly what you told us it should do: business requirements are coded as automated tests that drive the development process.<p>

				<p>We are technology agnostic, selecting the right tools for each product's requirements. This allows us to reduce technical debt and total cost of ownership. With us, the technology works for your business and gets out of the way, it doesn't restrict or control it.</p>

				<p>We offer two packages to our clients:</p>

				<h3>Full lifecycle</h3>
				
				<p>This package offers full coverage of the software lifecycle, including consultation, analysis and design phases, an SLA, and unlimited change requests with our <strong>pay-as-you-go</strong> contract terms. If you think your users or organization will want continuous iterations after the product is finished, this package delivers peace of mind, value and flexibility.</p>
